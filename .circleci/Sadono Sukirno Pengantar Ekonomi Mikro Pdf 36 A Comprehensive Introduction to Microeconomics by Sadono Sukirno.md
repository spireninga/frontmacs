## Features and Benefits
 
One of the main strengths of this book is its clarity and simplicity. The author, Sadono Sukirno, is a professor of economics at the University of Indonesia and has extensive experience in teaching and writing about microeconomics. He explains the concepts and theories in a concise and easy-to-understand manner, using graphs, tables, and diagrams to illustrate his points. He also avoids unnecessary jargon and technical details that might confuse or bore the readers.
 
Another strength of this book is its relevance and applicability. The author provides many examples and case studies from the Indonesian economy and society, such as the impact of fuel subsidies on consumer behavior, the role of cooperatives in rural development, the effects of minimum wage on labor markets, and the challenges of environmental protection. These examples help the readers to relate the abstract concepts to real-world situations and problems. They also show how microeconomics can be used as a tool for analysis and policy-making.
 
A third strength of this book is its comprehensiveness and depth. The book covers all the major topics and subtopics in microeconomics, from the basics of demand and supply to the more advanced topics of market failure and public goods. It also includes some topics that are not commonly found in other textbooks, such as game theory, behavioral economics, and information economics. The book provides a balanced and thorough treatment of each topic, without sacrificing rigor or accuracy.
 
## Limitations and Drawbacks
 
Despite its many advantages, this book also has some limitations and drawbacks that should be noted by potential readers. One of them is its outdatedness. The book was first published in 1994 and has been revised several times since then. However, some of the data, examples, and references used in the book are still based on older sources and may not reflect the current situation or trends in Indonesia or in the world. For instance, some of the statistics on GDP, inflation, poverty, and trade are from the 1990s or early 2000s. Some of the examples on market structure and competition are also based on industries that have changed significantly over time, such as telecommunications, banking, and airlines.
 
Another limitation of this book is its lack of diversity and inclusivity. The book mainly focuses on the Indonesian context and perspective, which may limit its applicability and relevance for readers from other countries or regions. Moreover, the book does not adequately address some of the social and ethical issues that are related to microeconomics, such as gender inequality, racial discrimination, environmental justice, and human rights. The book also does not incorporate some of the recent developments and innovations in microeconomics, such as behavioral experiments, randomized controlled trials, big data analysis, and digital platforms.
