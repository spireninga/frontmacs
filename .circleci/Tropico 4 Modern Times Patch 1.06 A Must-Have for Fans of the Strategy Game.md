Here are some tips and tricks to help you play Tropico 4 Modern Times with Patch 1.06:

- Use the new buildings wisely. Some of them have high maintenance costs or environmental impacts. For example, the biofarm produces more food but also more pollution. The solar plant generates clean energy but also takes up a lot of space.
- Balance your relations with the superpowers. You can benefit from their aid and trade, but also risk their interference and aggression. For example, the US may offer you money and tourists, but also demand you to adopt their policies and values. The USSR may offer you weapons and technology, but also expect you to join their bloc and ideology.
- Keep an eye on the new issues and events. Some of them may offer you opportunities or challenges that affect your island and your people. For example, the internet may increase your education and entertainment levels, but also expose you to hackers and cyberattacks. The space program may boost your prestige and economy, but also require a lot of resources and research.
- Use the new edicts and traits to your advantage. Some of them can help you achieve your goals or overcome your problems. For example, the media independence edict can increase your liberty and happiness ratings, but also reduce your propaganda effectiveness. The spin doctor trait can make your speeches and promises more convincing, but also increase your corruption level.

Tropico 4 Modern Times Patch 1.06 is a great addition to the game that enhances the gameplay and the graphics. It offers more variety and challenge for both new and experienced players. If you want to rule your island in the modern era, you should give it a try.
