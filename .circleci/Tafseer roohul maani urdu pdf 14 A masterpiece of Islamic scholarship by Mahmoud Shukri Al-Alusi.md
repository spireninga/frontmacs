## Surah al-Hijr
 
Surah al-Hijr is the fifteenth chapter of the Quran. It consists of 99 verses and was revealed in Mecca.

- Verses 9-29: Allah declares that He has protected the Quran from any corruption or alteration. He also describes how He created the angels from light and the jinn from fire. He then narrates how He created Adam (peace be upon him) from clay and how Iblis (Satan) refused to prostrate to him out of arrogance and became an enemy to mankind.
- Verses 30-50: Allah recounts some of the stories of His prophets, such as Ibrahim (Abraham), Lut (Lot), Ishaq (Isaac), Yaqub (Jacob), and Ismail (Ishmael) (peace be upon them all). He also mentions how He saved them and their followers from their enemies and how He bestowed His favors upon them.
- Verses 51-77: Allah relates the story of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and his guests, who were angels sent to inform him of the birth of his son Ishaq (peace be upon him) and to destroy the people of Lut (peace be upon him) for their wickedness. He also mentions how He saved Lut (peace be upon him) and his family from the punishment, except for his wife who was among the losers.
- Verses 78-99: Allah reminds the disbelievers of Mecca of the examples of the people of al-Hijr, Thamud, A'ad, Pharaoh, and others who were destroyed for their disbelief and disobedience.
