The game was released in 2008 on Windows, and it is still available and playable with some tinkering[^1^]. It is the first Rayman game to have an E10+ rating by the ESRB, a greater emphasis on simultaneous multiplayer gameplay compared to the original game, and online leaderboards[^2^]. It is followed by Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party in 2008, Rabbids Go Home in 2009, and Raving Rabbids: Travel in Time in 2010[^4^].
 
If you are looking for a fun and wacky party game for PC, you can download Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 from various sources online. However, you may need to apply some fixes and patches to make it run smoothly on modern systems[^3^]. You can also check out the other games in the series for more Rabbid madness.

The minigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 are played by entering a mode known as 'Trips', which is divided into five regions of the Earth: USA, Europe, Asia, South America, and Tropics. The game features 54 minigames with 9 divided upon each region, 5 of which are randomly chosen each time the player begins a trip[^3^]. The minigames can be played solo or with up to four players[^2^].
 
Some of the minigames are based on popular culture references, such as Singing In The Rain, Satisfaction, Smoke On The Water, and American Football[^1^]. Others are based on humorous scenarios involving the Rabbids, such as Burgerinis, Bunnies Crash, BunnFormer, and Papa's Got R[^1^]. The minigames vary in gameplay and difficulty, ranging from rhythm games, shooting games, racing games, puzzle games, and more[^4^]. The minigames are designed to be fun and wacky, and to showcase the Rabbids' personality and humor.

Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 was released for the Wii and Nintendo DS platforms worldwide in 2007, and for Microsoft Windows in some regions in 2008[^1^]. The game has some differences between the PC and Wii versions, mainly in terms of graphics and controls. The PC version has higher resolution and more detailed textures, but also requires more system requirements[^2^]. The Wii version has more motion-based controls that utilize the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, while the PC version uses the mouse and keyboard or a gamepad[^3^]. The Wii version also has more online features, such as leaderboards and downloadable content[^1^]. The PC version, however, has a modding community that has created custom levels and minigames for the game.

Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor, multiplayer mode, and character customization, but criticized its minigame quality, repetition, and lack of innovation. The game has an average score of 67% on Metacritic for the Wii version, 63% for the DS version, and 55% for the PC version. Some of the common complaints were that the minigames were too easy, too short, or too similar to each other or to those from the previous game[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. Some reviewers also noted that the game did not make full use of the Wii's motion controls or online features[^1^] [^2^], and that the PC version suffered from technical issues and poor controls[^3^] . However, some reviewers also found the game to be fun and charming, especially with friends, and enjoyed the variety of minigames and references[^1^] [^2^] . The game was also praised for its hilarious presentation, quirky music, and creative customization options[^1^] [^2^] .
