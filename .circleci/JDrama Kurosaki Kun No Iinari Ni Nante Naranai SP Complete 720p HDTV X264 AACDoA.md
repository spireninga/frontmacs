The special episode (SP) is a sequel to the 2016 movie and the two-part drama series that aired in 2015. It takes place two years after the events of the movie, where Yu and Haruto are now in their third year of high school and face new challenges in their relationship. The SP also introduces new characters, such as Haruto's childhood friend Rina and Yu's rival Mio.
 
The SP is a satisfying conclusion to the live-action adaptation of *Defying Kurosaki-kun*, as it shows how the characters have grown and matured over time. The chemistry between the main actors, Nana Komatsu and Yudai Chiba, is still strong and they deliver some sweet and funny moments as Yu and Haruto. The supporting cast also does a good job of portraying their roles, especially Kento Nakajima as Takumi, who adds some spice to the love triangle.
 
The SP is available in high-definition quality (720p) with AAC audio encoding. It has a runtime of about 90 minutes and can be downloaded from various online sources.

One of the highlights of the SP is the scene where Yu and Haruto go on a date to an amusement park. They have fun riding the roller coaster, eating cotton candy, and taking pictures. However, their date is interrupted by Rina, who claims to be Haruto's fiancee and tries to separate them. Yu is shocked and hurt by this revelation, but Haruto assures her that he only loves her and that Rina is lying. He then proves his love by kissing Yu in front of everyone, including Rina and Takumi.
 
Another memorable scene is the one where Yu and Haruto attend their graduation ceremony. They are both happy and proud of their achievements, but also sad to part ways with their friends. They decide to go to the same university and promise to stay together forever. They also exchange rings as a symbol of their commitment. The SP ends with a montage of their future lives, where they get married and have a daughter who looks like Yu.
 
The SP is a must-watch for fans of *Defying Kurosaki-kun*, as it wraps up the story in a satisfying way. It also gives a glimpse of what happens after the happy ending, which is rare in shoujo adaptations. The SP is a heartwarming and humorous story that will make you smile and cry.
  
The SP is not without its flaws, however. Some viewers might find the plot too predictable and cliched, as it follows the typical tropes of shoujo manga. Some scenes might also feel rushed or forced, such as the sudden appearance of Rina and Mio, who seem to have no other purpose than to create conflict. Some fans might also be disappointed by the lack of screen time for Takumi, who is reduced to a secondary role in the SP.
 
Despite these shortcomings, the SP is still an enjoyable watch for those who love romance and comedy. The SP is faithful to the original manga and captures its essence well. The SP also showcases the talents of the young actors, who bring their characters to life with charm and charisma. The SP is a treat for the eyes and ears, as it features beautiful cinematography and catchy music.
